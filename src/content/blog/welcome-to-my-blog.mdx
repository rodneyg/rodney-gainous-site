# Welcome to My Blog

I'm excited to launch this blog as a space to share my thoughts on AI, robotics, health tech, startups, and the intersection of technology and human potential.

## Why Start a Blog?

Over the years, I've written on Medium and Substack, but I wanted a space that was truly mine - where I could experiment with format, design, and content without constraints. This blog is built with MDX, which gives me the flexibility to integrate interactive components and visualizations directly into my posts.

## What to Expect

You can expect posts about:

- **AI & Machine Learning**: Insights from building AI-powered products
- **Health Tech**: Innovations in healthcare technology and medical devices
- **Startups & Entrepreneurship**: Lessons learned from raising capital and building companies
- **Product Development**: Deep dives into building products people love
- **Personal Growth**: Reflections on continuous learning and improvement

## Let's Connect

I'd love to hear your thoughts on what I write. Feel free to reach out via the contact form on the main site or connect with me on social media.

Here's to new beginnings! ðŸš€
