# Building AI Products That Matter

Building AI products is both exhilarating and challenging. Over the past few years, I've worked on several AI-powered projects, including SafeDose, an AI visual assistant for medication dosing. Here are some lessons I've learned along the way.

## Start with a Real Problem

The best AI products solve real, tangible problems. With SafeDose, we identified that medication dosing errors are a significant cause of harm in healthcare. The solution needed to be:

1. **Accessible**: Work on devices people already have
2. **Intuitive**: Require minimal training to use
3. **Reliable**: Accurate enough for clinical use

## AI is a Tool, Not the Product

It's easy to get caught up in the technology, but users don't care about your model architecture or accuracy metrics. They care about whether it solves their problem better than existing solutions.

## Design for Trust

In health tech, trust is paramount. We designed SafeDose with multiple safety checks:

- Visual confirmation of dosing
- Clear error messages
- Gradual guidance rather than sudden corrections
- Transparent about limitations

## The Importance of Feedback Loops

AI products improve with use, but only if you build proper feedback mechanisms. We implemented:

- Usage analytics to understand common patterns
- Error logging for edge cases
- User feedback collection
- Continuous model improvements

## Key Takeaways

1. **Solve real problems**: Don't build AI for AI's sake
2. **Focus on UX**: The best model is worthless if it's unusable
3. **Build trust**: Especially critical in sensitive domains like healthcare
4. **Iterate constantly**: Use real-world feedback to improve

Building AI products that truly matter requires balancing technical excellence with deep user empathy. It's challenging work, but incredibly rewarding when you see your product making a real difference.
