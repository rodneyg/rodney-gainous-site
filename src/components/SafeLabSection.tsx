            SafeLab is my personal R&D environment where I prototype open-source tools at the intersection of AI, health technology, and security. It's where ideas take tangible form before reaching the wider world.

            Some projects remain experimental proofs-of-concept, while others evolve into full products like SafeDose. The lab serves as a proving ground for tools that should exist but don't yetâ€”filling gaps where technology can enhance health, safety, and digital autonomy.
